 *  The purpose of this file is to be compiled into an executable
 *  called `show-diff`. When `show-diff` is run from the command line
 *  it does not take any command line arguments.
 *
 *  The `show-diff` command is used to show the differences between
 *  files staged in the index and the current versions of those files
 *  as they exist in the filesystem.
 *
 *  Everything in the main function in this file will run
 *  when ./show-diff executable is run from the command line.

#include "cache.h"
/* The above 'include' allows use of the following functions and
   variables from "cache.h" header file, ranked in order of first use
   in this file. Most are functions/macros from standard C libraries
   that are `#included` in "cache.h". Function names are followed by
   parenthesis whereas variable/struct names are not:

   -snprintf(char *s, size_t n, const char *format, ...):
        Write the formatted string `format` into `s`, with `n` specifying the 
        maximum number of characters that should be written to `s`, including 
        the null terminating character.

   -popen(command, mode): Create a pipe between the calling program and a 
                          shell command and return a pointer to a stream that 
                          enables read or write access to the command 
                          depending on the value of mode. Sourced from 
                          <stdio.h>.

   -fwrite(data, size, nitems, stream): Write up to `nitems`, each of size 
                                        `size`, from array `data` to `stream`.
                                        Sourced from <stdio.h>.

   -pclose(stream): Close a stream that was opened by popen(). Sourced from 
                    <stdio.h>.

   -read_cache(): Reads the contents of the `.dircache/index` file into the 
                  `active_cache` array. 

   -printf(message, ...): Write `message` to standard output stream stdout.  
                          Sourced from <stdio.h>.

   -free(ptr): Deallocates the space pointed to by `ptr`. Sourced from 
               <stdlib.h>.
